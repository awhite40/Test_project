<p align="center">This is a **practice post** where I am trying out the *different functionalities* of Stack Edit.  </p>

 - This is where I would put random information
 - Are there different levels of bullets?
	 - Apparently using a tab before the statement works

This is an image:

Couldn't embed a slideshow but the next post will be a slide show


What would codes look like?
{% highlight matlab %}
%% Load file
%this takes a long time don't do it if you don't need to
I = imread('C:\Users\awhite40\Documents\research\DARPA project\seg_LA1.png','BackgroundColor','none');
% Make it grayscale
data = rgb2gray(I);
%Remove border
data = data(10:1126,30:770); 
%Discretize
data(data<100)=0;
data(data>200)=2;
data(data>2) =1;
imshow(data, [0 2])
{% endhighlight %}
